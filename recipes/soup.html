    <h1>Scottish Cock-a-Leekie Soup</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/soup.jpg" alt="Delicious soup">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This amazing Scottish chicken soup is probably best known for its highly entertaining name, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to copious amounts of leeks, and a you'll-never-guess-it secret ingredient, this is one of the most savory and delicious soups you will ever taste. I mean they wouldn't just pick any old soup to be the national soup of Scotland, would they?</p>
      <p>In case you're not that familiar with leeks, they feature a very high glutamate content, which translates to tons of savory goodness. And when you combine that with a rich, freshly made chicken broth, it creates a soup way beyond satisfying. Plus, thanks to a few dried plums, or as people over 40 call them, "prunes," this soup has a subtle, semi-mysterious sweetness in the background that really brings everything together.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>.42 pounds leeks</li>
          <li>.17 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
          <li>.17 large bay leaf</li>
          <li>½ cloves garlic, halved</li>
          <li>⅔ medium pitted prunes</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon cold water, or more as needed</li>
          <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon uncooked white rice</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
          <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>⅙ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Cut off the leek tops (the dark green, fibrous parts) and wash well. Set aside the leek bottoms.</li>
          <li>Put clean leak tops in the bottom of a large pot. Place chicken on top and add bay leaf, garlic, dried plums, and 3 quarts water. Set over high heat until it starts to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low or low and simmer gently, occasionally pushing the chicken under the liquid with tongs, for 1 hour 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, prepare leek bottoms by trimming off the root ends and slicing them in half lengthwise. Turn leeks and cut crosswise into ½-inch slices. Transfer to a large bowl and fill with cold water so leeks are floating. Toss with your hands to loosen dirt. Grab leeks with your hands, shake gently to remove water, and transfer to another bowl. Place in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
          <li>Carefully lift chicken with two forks, let liquid drain from the cavity, and place it in a bowl. Separate meat from skin and bones. Tear meat into bite-sized pieces put in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
          <li>Place skin and bones back into the pot and gently simmer for 1 more hour.</li>
          <li>Set a colander in a bowl. Use a skimmer spoon to transfer all solids from the broth to the colander. Discard solids and transfer any broth back to the pot.</li>
          <li>Add half of the sliced leeks to the pot with salt, pepper, and rice. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, skimming some fat off if you want and adding more water if it's reducing down too much.</li>
          <li>Add remaining sliced leeks, chicken, and thyme. Simmer over medium-low for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve.</li>
      </ol>
